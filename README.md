**CryptaKey** is a secure (and surprisingly good-looking) **Password Manager Web App** built with the **MERN Stack**  
*(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)* — because we believe in both safety *and* style.

Tired of typing **"forgot password?"** more than your actual password?  
Yeah, us too.

CryptaKey helps you **store**, **manage**, and **retrieve** all your passwords without sticky notes, spreadsheets,  
or relying on your “memory” (we both know that’s not working).

All in a smooth, responsive UI that doesn’t look like it was made in 2004.
